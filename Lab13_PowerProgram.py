# 1. Name:
#      Brodric Young
# 2. Assignment Name:
#      Lab 13: Power
# 3. Assignment Description:
#      Calculate the maximum average power for any given continuous subset in a full set of power integers
# 4. What was the hardest part? Be as specific as possible.
#      Getting the test cases and the regular user input parts to work together to not duplicate code but be seperate at the same time
# 5. How long did it take for you to complete the assignment?
#      About 2 hours
